# Parallel K-Means Data Clustering (MPI)
This repository contains the code for the
Parallel Programming and Computing Final Group
Project. The implementation is parallelized and
uses MPI to run on the Blue Gene/Q supercomputer.
The code is intended to run on "AMOS", the CCI
Blue Gene/Q system at RPI.
